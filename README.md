Market Sentiment Analysis Bot 🤖
This README provides a comprehensive overview of the Market Sentiment Analysis Bot, a powerful tool designed to help you gauge market sentiment from various sources.

📖 Description
The Market Sentiment Analysis Bot is an automated system that collects and analyzes data from different platforms to determine the prevailing sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) towards a specific asset, topic, or market. It uses natural language processing (NLP) to process text data and provide a quantifiable sentiment score, helping you make more informed decisions.

⚙️ Features
Real-time Data Collection: Gathers data from social media, news articles, and financial forums in real-time. 📈

Sentiment Scoring: Employs an NLP model to assign a sentiment score to each piece of text. The scores typically range from -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive).

Trend Visualization: Provides visual representations of sentiment trends over time, making it easy to spot shifts in market mood.

Customizable Queries: Allows users to specify keywords, assets (e.g., stock tickers), or topics for analysis.

Alert System: Notifies users when sentiment towards a specific query crosses a predefined threshold. 🚨
